2. Download the ZIP file for the desired blockpack and extract.
3. Remove the blockpack folder from within the ZIP file or skip to step 4 if the textures lang and types folders are visible.
4. Place the blockpack's folder in the `config/chiseldecor` directory.
5. Edit the `config/chiseldecor/config.json` file. The entry `block_packs` should be a comma separated list of the names of the  blockpacks you want to load. A list should look like "cool, red".
